  > Impossible is temporary.

I am a 3rd year Btech CSE Student at Gitam University. I am fortunate enough to be advised by prof Shanti Chilukuri in the field of Computer networks. Specifically using <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> on the field of Computer networks from the lens of improving delay and robustness.

I love working on difficult problems, and challenging myself constantly to push beyond my limits.
